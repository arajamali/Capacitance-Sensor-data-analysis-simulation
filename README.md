Three probes are installed in our facility that could measure and report voltage at their locations. 
Probe 1, is very close to the inlet, 2nd probe is in the middle and the last probe is near outlet 
where more developed flow is expected. Since the water and gas have different conductivities, 
the measured voltage is a function of liquid and gas percentage. To perfectly use the data 
generated by the probe to obtain required parameters, a simulator needed to be developed to 
analyze the data and return useful parameters. The analysis later is compared to other methods 
including image analysis, quick closing valve holdup measurements and videos. 
The parameters which are expected to be obtained are
slug liquid holdup, 
slug length, 
film liquid holdup, 
film length, 
transitional velocity, 
slug frequency and bubble distribution in slugs.
